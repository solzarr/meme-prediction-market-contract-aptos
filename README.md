# Aptos Gamefied Prediction Market For Memes

Gamified prediction market where users bet on whether memes will go viral within a week, earning rewards in Aptos Coin. By integrating blockchain-powered betting with meme culture, AptosOdds transforms viral content into a decentralized economy that rewards creators and engaged communities.

## Features
- Bet on the virality of trending memes
- Weekly prediction rounds
- Rewards distributed in Aptos Coin
- Transparent and decentralized using Aptos blockchain
- Community-driven meme selection and voting

## How It Works
1. **Meme Selection:** Memes are nominated and selected for each weekly round.
2. **Betting:** Users place bets on whether a meme will go viral (reach a certain threshold of engagement) within the week.
3. **Resolution:** At the end of the week, the contract checks if the meme met the virality criteria.
4. **Rewards:** Winners share the prize pool, distributed automatically by the smart contract.

## Smart Contract Structure
- **PredictionMarket.move:** Main contract handling bets, rounds, and reward distribution.
- **MemeRegistry.move:** Manages meme nominations and selection.
- **Utils.move:** Helper functions for calculations and validations.
